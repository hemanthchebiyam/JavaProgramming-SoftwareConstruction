Create a README.txt file in your project and answer the following questions:
a. How is this lab an example of reuse through inheritance?

Answer: 
The implementation of different types of Pokemon (FireTypePokemon, GrassTypePokemon, and WaterTypePokemon) is achieved through inheritance. 
These subclasses extend the base "Pokemon" class, inheriting its common attributes and methods, such as name, attack, health, takeDamage method, and isConscious method. 
By utilizing inheritance, common functionalities and properties are centralized in the base class (Pokemon), and specific behaviors related to different Pok√©mon types are implemented in their respective subclasses. 
This approach allows for code reuse, as the common functionalities are defined once in the base class and can be reused by all subclasses.
